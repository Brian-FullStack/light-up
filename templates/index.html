            It may feel isolating to live in a rural area far from the supports available to urban dwelling members of the
            LGBTQ+ community. However, you are not alone. Light Up enables rural users to interact by lighting up our map
            with events. These may include coding sessions as well as more casual meetups. Join us and light up our map to
            show others they are not alone.
